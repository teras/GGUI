# GGUI
Create Operating System dependent wizards without knowing anything about programming

# Compiling

You will need at least Java 2 in order to compile this program.
(I have test it with Java 1.4 & 1.5)

Make sure that the programs "javac", "jar" and "java" are in your
path and then write "make" at the command prompt. It *should* coumpile everything.


# Running

To execute GGUI, first it is wise to set an alias, since java & linux is not always
a flexible combination!
Use the following command (in a bash shell):

`alias ggui="java -jar /PATH/TO/ggui-0.5.0/bin/ggui.jar"`

Now, you can try the following commands:

`ggui --help`

or

`ggui demo`


More extensive information can be found in the documentation of this package
(under the directory "doc").
