<H2><A NAME="datafile-format"></A> <A NAME="s7">7. GGUI datafile format </A></H2>

<P>This part of the documnet is for advanced users/develpers only. If you just
want to use GGUI or make datafiles there is no need to read this section.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 General Structural Information</A>
</H2>

<P>The format of this file is like the *.INI files. It is divided into
sections. Every section has a header and one or more entries. To distinguish
the header it is enclosed in "[" and "]". The entries have a keyword followed
by "=" and then by the parameter. A simple section has this form: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[SectionHead]
Entry1=Data1
Entry2=another data
a_number=34
blankEntry=
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

An entry CAN'T begin with the "[". This character is reserved for the head
of the section. The head of the section is not case sensitive. Any blank
lines will be ommited. For readability reasons you should leave a blank line
between the various sections, although it is not needed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Text Issues</A>
</H2>

<H3>Spaces and case sensitivity</H3>

<P>The keywords of an entry can have leading and trailing [SPACE]s and [TAB]s.
WARNING: all spaces IN the keywords ARE importand. E.g. "_key_" and "key" are
equal, but "anotherkey" and "another_key" are not (for displaying reasons the
[SPACE] character is substituded with the [UNDERSCORE] character). 
<DL>
<DT><B>Note:</B><DD><P>
<UL>
<LI>the " character is only to mark the beginning and the end of the
keywords.</LI>
<LI>The keywords are NOT case sensitive. So "key", "Key", "KEY" akd "KeY"
are the same. </LI>
<LI>The parameters of this entry ARE case and blank sensitive. So
"key=locked" and "key=Locked " is NOT the same. </LI>
<LI>In some special cases, the parameters are not blank &amp; case sensitive
too. But if not other stated you should know that spaces and the case IS
importand.</LI>
</UL>
 
</DL>
<P>
<H3>String Parameters</H3>

<P>Many entries have a string of characters for a parameter. This string is not
passed directly to the main-program, but it is changed first to make it more
functional. The string-proccessor searches for the following strings and
replaces them:
<DL>
<DT><B>\n</B><DD><P>New line character. This character marks the beginning of a new line in Un*x
environments.
<DT><B>\r</B><DD><P>Return character. This character together with the "\n" character (i.e.
"\n\r\" ) marks the beggining of a new line in a Widow$ environment.
<DT><B>\l</B><DD><P>OS-independent new line character. Use this if you want to produce a new-line
on <B>any</B> OS. This is default for a newline-like character.
<DT><B>\b</B><DD><P>Delete character. Use this to delete the last displayed character.
<DT><B>\f</B><DD><P>New page character. Used mainly for printing.
<DT><B>\'</B><DD><P>The actual ' character. Still you can use simply the same character without
the \ sighn.
<DT><B>\"</B><DD><P>The actual " character. Still you can use simply the same character without
the \ sighn.
<DT><B>\\</B><DD><P>The actual \ character
</DL>

If the character after the \ is not any of the above, then the output will be
\? , where ? is the following character. If the last character on a line is \,
then the output will be \ again.
<P>Use these codes if for any reason you will like to produce these characters.
If you want you can even make on the fly whole script files from the GGUI
environment!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 GGUI Objects </A>
</H2>

<P>Everything you see on the main Panel of the Wizard is an object. You can
imagine an object as an information for the end user or as a parameter of
the caller program. In the future more and more objects will be added. The
supported objects are listed in the 
<A HREF="ggui-6.html#tools">tools section</A> of
the Creator program.
<P>Every object has a keyword "type" which describes the type of this object.
This keyword is NOT case sensitive. Also not case sensitive is the "GUIType"
keyword.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Describing of the Sections </A>
</H2>

<H3>General</H3>

<P>This section exists in any ggui datafile. It contains basic information for
the wizard to be displayed. Parameters:
<DL>
<DT><B>Program=</B><DD><P>The <B>actual</B> filename of the target-program (the executable).
<DL>
<DT><B>Tip:</B><DD><P>This program is NOT executed directly through Java. Instead Java launches a
shell and executes the commands <B>through</B> this shell. This has many
advantages; you can use any of the shell's utilities, such as variables
e.t.c., you can use parameters with the " character, you can even create
whole script files on the fly instead of executing a simple command only when
you use "\l" characters in your parameters! These commands could be even in
the options parameters!
</DL>
<DT><B>ProgramTail=</B><DD><P>The ending text of the target program. This is useful if you want to add some
special characters at the end of your command.
<DT><B>Pages=</B><DD><P>How many pages is this wizard. It is an integer value.
<DT><B>WindowTitle=</B><DD><P>The window title of the wizard.
<DT><B>Windowed=</B><DD><P>Set it to true if you want the results to appear in a special window. Set it
to false to appear on the console.
</DL>
<P>
<H3>Page?</H3>

<P>Every page of the wizard has a section like this which describes general
information for this page. First page is number 1, so the first entry should
be [Page1] , then [Page2] and so on. Parameters:
<DL>
<DT><B>Objects=</B><DD><P>How many objects appear in this page. You have to count all object of this
page.
<DT><B>Image=</B><DD><P>The wizard can display in every page an image. If you don't want to display
an image leave this section blank. Warning: it's better to specify the full
path of this image, or the GGUI will not be able to find this picture and
ignore it. (This should be change somehow...)
<DT><B>Interactive=</B><DD><P>You can use interactive wizards too. E.g. by selecting on a special option
to go to a different page than the "next" one. To see how to use it, look at
the [P?Interactive] section below. Can be true/enabled/yes/on or
false/disabled/no/off. 
<DT><B>canFinish</B><DD><P>Use this entry with true/yes if you want the wizard to be able to exit on
this page. Otherwise the "Finish" button will be shadowed on this page.
Remember that on the last page the "Finish" button is always enabled.
</DL>
<P>
<H3>P?Interactive</H3>

<P>With this section you define an interactive wizard. First you have to
declare this page as interactive (see section [Page?]). Then you have to name
a gguiObject as interactive object. Parameters:
<DL>
<DT><B>Object=</B><DD><P>Which object in this page will be an interactive object. Such objects are
Boolean and Chooser.
<DT><B>on?jumpto=</B><DD><P>Page number to jump to. If for example the first option is selected, the
wizard will jump to the page stored in on1jumpto, if the second option is
selected, the wizard will jump to the page stored in on2jumpto etc. As a
parameter it takes an integer number in the range 1 - {MAX_PAGES}
</DL>
<P>
<H3>P?Object*</H3>

<P>Every object on every page has an entry like this. Here is described the
object. First object on first page has section [P1Object1], second object on
first page [P1Object2], first object on second page [P2Object1], second
object on second page [P2Object2] and so on. The parameters for each object
are different.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.12">7.12 Creating you own gguiObjects (for java developers only) </A>
</H2>

<P>Creating you own objects is rather easy. First you have to put it under
package panos.ggui.objects . Then the name should follow some rules: 
<UL>
<LI>must begin with ggui </LI>
<LI>next character should be uppercase </LI>
<LI>all other characters should be lowercase</LI>
<LI> numbers are allowed (just on any other java class)</LI>
</UL>

For example to create an object named myobject, the class should be
gguiMyobject. If you don't follow these rules the GGUI will not find it.
New GGUI objects should extend the gguiObject Class.
<P>It can override the following methods: 
<DL>
<DT><B>void importData (int page, int object, PropertiesSection prop)</B><DD><P>Maybe the most difficult one. With this method you can collect information
from the PropertiesSection class. E.g. to collect information from the
field "myfield" you will have to write something like this: String myfield =
prop.getValue ("myfield"); The PropertiesSection class will
find this entry and assign it to the myfield string. 
<DT><B>Component createGUI()</B><DD><P>Here creates the actual visual-objects of
every object. You can create for example a java.awt.Panel and
put in it everything you like. 
<DT><B>Panel getCreatorPanel()</B><DD><P>Return the UI in a form of a panel for the Creator program. Add here all the
controls you need in order to visually define this object.
<DT><B>String getPropertiesSection(boolean onlyDefault)</B><DD><P>Returns a PropertiesSection Class describing the object for the specified
object. If the onlyDefault is true you should return the parameters which have
been changed. If it is false you have to return a complete describing of this
object.
<DT><B>String getParam()</B><DD><P>Return the result of this paramater/object,
depends onb what is selected.
<DT><B>int getInteractive()</B><DD><P>Return the index number of the selected option in this object. Should be
between 1 and the maximum number of option.
