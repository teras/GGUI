<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Frequently asked questions</A></H2>

<P>For any problem you experience, please give me a note! I will be glad to
help you! 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 When I try to run GGUI from the command line, I get some SIGSEGVs and the program crashes. What to do next? </A>
</H2>

<P>This is not a GGUI's problem, it's a JDK's. That means you have found a bug
in the Java Development Kit, not for the GGUI program itself. GGUI bugs
produce "exceptions" not SIGSEGVs. The only thing you can do now is upgrade
to a major version number JDK and hope that they have fixed the bug. The
people who informed about it they have a glibc2 based system (e.g. Redhat
5.2). I have reports that JDK v 1.1.7 works fine with them, so this version
is recommended. Of course if you see any "exceptions", please contact me to
fix the bug.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 How can the wizard remember my settings, next time I call it?</A>
</H2>

<P>Good news! From version 0.3.0 onward the wizard remembers the last values you
enter and use it the next time you call it. All default values are saved in
directory <CODE>~/.ggui/</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Why don't exist many demo datafiles? </A>
</H2>

<P>Simple: I din't have the time to create any :-) I was hoping to create a
tool for GUI, not make datafiles for every program. So, ANYONE OF YOU is
welcomed to create some data files for this environment. It is NOT difficult
and you DON'T need to be programmer to create some. So, if you liked this and
you think that it can be better, CREATE SOME DATA FILES! 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 The "demo" datafile returns with an error "Cannot execute command"... </A>
</H2>

<P>Of course! This is only a demo script. It is not an actual datafile. It is
only a "sceleton" or a "demo-datafile" for educational and presentational
purposes only :-) 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Why in all text entries spaces are not allowed? </A>
</H2>

<P>Not anymore!! Now it <B>is</B> possible to enter text entries with spaces. But
now you have to be carefull with which shell do you install GGUI with. If you
want to write a datafile with text-entries which spaces are allowed don't
forget to enclose the parameter in "" (e.g. in leadText and in trailText)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Are datafiles shell-specific?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes and no. To run these commands you definately need a shell. The GGUI
passes the commands to shell (which you have defined during installation) and
the shell executes them. If you define normal commands, not shell-specific,
then the datafile is universal. Of course if you use shell-specific commands
then the datafile is shell-dependent too. In future versions you'll be able
to define shell-specific datafiles (if you want to). Remember that usually
you'll have problems, if you create scripts on the fly, not when you just
call a cli-target-program.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 Why do you need to create the data file using text ? Doesn't it half defeat the purpose ? </A>
</H2>

<P>Not any more! Now with Creator you <B>can</B> create data files in a completely
GUI environment! Of couse still this program is "heavy" and maybe buggy, but
I can't think of a more pleasant solution! If we want to create a GUI
environment, we have to collect information on HOW to display the various
options, WHAT to display and WHAT to execute.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.8">8.8 Is GGUI Java 1.2 compatible?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes! And not only that, but it's also rewritten in Swing!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.9">8.9 Why did you use Swing, since there is no fre implementation of swing (yet) and there are other toolkits available (like SWT)?</A>
</H2>

<P>The reason is simple: since I know Swing and I don't know SWT ;-)  Seriously now, since version 0.5.0 there is an effort to distinguish between the real GGUI code and the visual components being used. For this reason it has been used a "componenty proxy", namely the wVisuals library.<p>
Inside this library there are proxies for(almost) every Swing component being used. By changing this library to a SWT-based one, it sould be easy to port this program to SWT (or whatever you will like).
<p>
Contributions to this aspect will be highly appreciated
