</H2>

<P>This program is used to make life easier for a lot of us. The main aspect is
to create a graphical user interface (the way we talk to the computer, but in
a graphical - not textual - way). 
<P>Traditionally all the Un*x programs including Linux use the command line as
the main user interface for almost all programs. If you want to call a
program you write it's name on the console (or xterm) together with any
parameters of this program. This is very convenient for advanced users or for
script programming. But for all the other uses (and users) this is a
headache. Usually you have to remember all these switches and parameters and
examine the "man" page of this program or run this program once with a "help"
switch (e.g. "--help" or "-h") in order to dislay all the other switches of
this program. Even if you know the exact parameter, sometimes a typing
mistake will lead to unpredictable errors. 
<P>Part solutions to this problem have been introduced. Someone writes a
program (in C/C++ usually or in Tcl/Tk) which creates a nice UI
(user-interface) for this program. This ui-program runs before the actual
program (let's call it target-program), collects all the needed information
for the target-program and then executes it. These ui-programs are good, but
they have a great disadvantage: they are for one target-program only. If
something changes in the target-program, the ui-program has to change too. If
the writer of the ui-program can't correct it for the time being, then
the ui-program stays behind and (if you want to use it) you have to load an
older version of the target-program. 
<P>Of course anyone (especially ui-programs with GNU-GPL) can correct the
ui-program. But this means that the new writer should know the language of
the original ui-program and understand the way the programmer of the
ui-program constructs his/her program. 
<P>And now comes this environment. It's written in Java. Java has a lot of
disadvantages (needs a VM, difficult to customize and run, slower execution,
too heavy etc.) but has two big advantages: 
<UL>
<LI>It can run on any platform. There is no need to recompile it! </LI>
<LI> Java is an easily extendable and programmed language. I don't know if
I ever had the courage to write this program in */Tk alone (if I knew the
language...)</LI>
</UL>
