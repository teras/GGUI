<P>Let's say you have unpacked GGUI in directory. How can you use it? There are two
possible ways:
<UL>
<LI>Use an already defined data file for a target-program. This method is
recommended for novice users or for users who don't care for the actuall
parameters of a programm and have found a data file for their desired
target-program. Unfortunately there are only a very few data files ready :-(</LI>
<LI>Create a data-file and use it to call a program. The reason to do this
is simple: to use it for a program which has many and complicated parameters
and there isn't any UI for this program or to distribute it to others :-).
When you create such a file, please send it to me too.</LI>
</UL>
Since some of you are not familiar with the way Java handles "executable" JAR files, 
I'll comment here how to run them from the command prompt.
<UL>
<LI>First of all you need to have the "java"
executable in your $PATH. E.g. type "java" and see what happens.
</LI><LI>
Use an alias to run the GGUI environment. This makes things easier for you, since
you won't have to write a long command everytime you want to run GGUI.
<code>alias ggui="java -jar /PATH/TO/ggui-0.5.0/bin/ggui.jar"</code>
<p>
Now, everytime you write "ggui" on your console, the proper java initialization takes place.
<p>
<LI>For the rest of this document we will continue as if this alias command has been issued.</LI>
</UL>
<P>

</H2>

<P>At the command prompt type <CODE>ggui --help</CODE>. You will see information on how to run
the GGUI program, together with a list of included data files. With this
version of GGUI there are only these datafiles included:
<UL>
<LI>The demo datafile. This is a brief demostration of what the wizard can
do. Usage: <CODE>ggui demo</CODE></LI>
<LI>The xterm datafile. This is a demostration of an xterm command. Usage:
<CODE>ggui xterm</CODE></LI>
<LI>The a2ps datafile. This is a demostration of an a2ps command. Usage:
<CODE>ggui a2ps</CODE></LI>
<LI>The ggui datafile. This is a wrapper for all datafiles. Use it as an
entry point for both (by Mike Roeder). Usage: <CODE>ggui ggui</CODE></LI>
</UL>

In version 0.3.0 uninstall is not supported. Maybe in future versions if
it is really needed it will be supported too.
