<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Creating new datafiles</A></H2>

<P>At last! From version 0.4.0 there is an internal option to graphically create
a new datafile or edit an old one. There is no need to manually edit the
text file anymore. Still, if you still want to see the documentation about the
format of the data file you can have a look at the 
<A HREF="ggui-7.html#datafile-format">GGUI datafile format</A> section.
<P>Although it is not difficult to understand how to create a new file, I prefer
to give step-by-step information so that anyone can easily create such a file.
What to do: 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Preperation stage</A>
</H2>

<P>First you need to gather some general information. 
<UL>
<LI>Decide for which program you want to create a UI. </LI>
<LI>Learn which are its parameters. To do so run it without any parameter
or with the "-h" or "--help" or "-help" parameter, or even something like "-?".
Something should work and you will see a list of all possible parameters. </LI>
<LI>If these pages don't give enough information, try other sources. Type
<CODE>man {program-name}</CODE> </LI>
<LI>Use the info pages </LI>
<LI>Read the possible documentation of this program (usually found under
this directory "/usr/doc/.../target-program" - in my system is under
"/usr/doc/packages/target-name" ) </LI>
<LI>Make sure you noted all the possible or most needed switches and you
understood the usage of them. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Managing parameters. </A>
</H2>

<P>Think over each parameter : 
<UL>
<LI>Is it a switch (on &amp; off)?</LI>
<LI>Does it have more than one possibilities?</LI>
<LI>What is the default state of this parameter (when it's ommited)? </LI>
<LI>Do you HAVE to use it?</LI>
<LI>Do you have to write extra text for this parameter? </LI>
</UL>
<P>Because you have to visually appear them on your screen as a wizard think
about this too: 
<UL>
<LI>Can you group some parameters together? </LI>
<LI>How many groups can you make? </LI>
<LI>Do you need to show all the parameters or some of them are not
so importand and can be completely ommited?</LI>
<LI>Some parameters are importand, but only for experienced users? You can
use the interactive wizard possiblity to create an "Advanced option" section,
so that it will not be neccesary for an unexperienced user to see all these
parameters.</LI>
<LI>Which group is more importand?</LI>
<LI>Should some perameters been put <B>before</B> others?</LI>
<LI>Can the user be able to exit the wizard in the middle, and use the
default values for the remaining ones?</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Creating the data file.</A>
</H2>

<P>It's time now to write the data file. First you have to decide what name to
give to the new datafile. If you give a name for an already existing
datafile, then GGUI will edit that file. If this filename can't be found,
GGUI will create this new file. The command to use is <CODE>ggui -create
<B>datafile</B></CODE>, where <B>datafile</B> is your desired name. You
should not provide the ".ggui" extension. The wizard will automatically
append it for you. You don't even have to worry where to save this file -
this is done automatically too. If you want information about the screen go
to the 
<A HREF="ggui-6.html#creator-screen">description of the Creator screen</A>
section.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Transform the parameters of the target-application to GGUI objects</A>
</H2>

<P>Now it is time to "fill the gaps". What you can do:
<UL>
<LI> Start adding pages. For any group of parameters use a special wizard
page.</LI>
<LI> For every page start adding objects, depending the type of parameter.</LI>
<LI> The more important parameters/objects and pages of course should be as
close to the beginning as possible.</LI>
<LI> The advanced parameters (if any) should be at the end pages. </LI>
<LI>It's a good tradition to leave the last page of the wizard without any
parameters, only displaying a text like "Click on finish to go on." so that
the wizard will be more understandable and much easier to handle for
interactive wizards.</LI>
<LI>If you want an image to display on the left you have to write the
filename of the image for every page. All images should be saved under the
GGUI_HOME/img directory.</LI>
<LI>Some objects can be displayed with various GUI types. Select the one
which seems to be more apropriate.</LI>
<LI>Take attention with the spaces. Usually they are not importand, but
sometimes they are.</LI>
<LI>If you want a page to automatically jump to
another page and not to the next in the row, you can set interactivity to an
info object for example and define the first page to jump to in a Page
section to whatever you want to.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Test it </A>
</H2>

<P>Type <CODE>ggui datafile</CODE>, where datafile is the name you gave when you created
this datafile.The wizard should pop. Play a little bit with it. Is it
functional? Can others understand this wizard? Is it pretty? What do you
think of the results? If you are not satisfied try to correct the datafile
(edit it again). Run the wizard once more. Remember what you choosed and click
on the "Finish" button. Are the parameters as they supposed to be? Is there
any error? Does the target-program run correctly? Are there any
errors? Does it understand correctly all parameters? Play a little bit with
the parameters. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>No more installation is neccesary. Still if you want you can make even
easier the usage of the ggui environment. E.g. if you want to automatically
run the ggui wizard with the xterm data everytime you type xterm at your
command prompt, you can add this line to your .bashrc file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
alias xterm="ggui xterm" 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 What to do next. </A>
</H2>

<P>You can give this file to the public. You can post it anywhere. Please post
it to me too, so I can distribute it with the basic GGUI environment. You can
contact me and tell me if you liked my program. My e-amil address is
<A HREF="http://www.panayotis.com">http://www.panayotis.com</A><P>And that's all :-)
