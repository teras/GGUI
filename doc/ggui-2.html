<LI>This program actually creates a Wizard, just like the one shown in
Wiblow$ environments.</LI>
<LI>All the end-user input is done with the mouse.</LI>
<LI>All the real parameters are hidden from the end-user. They are defined
inside the program and called automatically.</LI>
<LI>The data for displaying the various parameters on screen and calling
the target-program are stored in a simple to edit text file.</LI>
<LI>The data files can now been edited within the GGUI environment.
There is no need to edit the raw file anymore. Just use the internal program
and let GGUI create and save the datafile for you!</LI>
<LI>The programm is the same for every UI. That means we don't need to
recompile the GGUI in order to display a different UI.</LI>
<LI>If someone has already installed GGUI, the only thing someone needs to
do to run a new UI for any program, is the new GGUI-data file for this
program. This is ideal for novice users who know what to do but they don't
need to know how to do it. Someone can create the new datafile and he is
ready!</LI>
<LI>The size of the various datafiles is very small relative to the
size of any target-program specific UI.</LI>
<LI>These wizards are interactive: that means you don't have to step over
all the parameters for this target-program but only the desired one. It's
ideal for "Advanced..." style wizards.</LI>
<LI> The wizard "remembers" the last selected options and use them the next
time you call it.</LI>
<LI> You can see results and exit codes on the console or on a special
window.</LI>
<LI>*NEW* The visual components are seperated from the main program. It should
be easy to write plugins which support other GUIs than Swing</LI>
</UL>

This application has one major disadvantage: It doesn't have almost any
datafiles ready. The only way is to create your own. It is not at all
dificult and I give step by step instructions on how to create them. I don't
have time to do so,
